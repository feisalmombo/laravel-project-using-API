## Laravel Application Using API

This is a simple project using an example of students records, where we will be creating students data, show, edit update, delete the students data using api in laravel. Once this REST API is successfully created, you can use this Laravel REST API for any frontend framework to make CRUD. (Like: Vue JS, React JS, Angular, Nuxt JS, etc).
